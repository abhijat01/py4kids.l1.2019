# Objective 

* Introduction to computers - hardware, OS, types of memory, programs etc. 
* Demonstrate how to use an editor to write code and then run it. 
* Start with hello world. 

## Details 
 * Simple variables, naming conventions, strings and integers, operators including % and assignment operator. 
 * input()  - also cover string vs ints and show the debugger.

 ## Code snippets 
### Input 
```python
name=input("Please tell me your name:")
print("Hello "+name+"!")
```

### Variables, types and operators. 
```python

```
### Modulo operator
```python
number=81 
possible_factor = 7 

remainder = number%possible_factor
print(remainder)
```

## Homework

### Run the following code 
```python
input_1 = input("Give me the first number please:")
input_2 = input("Give me the possible factor please:")

remainder = input_1 % input_2 
print(remainder) 
```
Why does it not run? Hint - use:  ```number_1 = int(input_1)``` 


* Finish making all changes so that the remainder is printed correctly. 
* What does the fix mean? 
* Write another joke as a program.
